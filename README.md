# spectrum

Matlab script that takes a 3 second recording of a pure tone and analyzes the fast fourier transform, or fft. Returns the frequency spectrum with all the harmonics above a certain threshold, and maps it to a database of instrument timbres to guess which instrument the pure tone is being played from.
